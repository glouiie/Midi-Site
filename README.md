Welcome to my musical passion project - The 3D Piano Site! 
Leveraging the powerful 3js and Tone.js libraries, I've built an interactive and immersive piano-playing experience that you can enjoy right in your web browser!

### Why did create this site?

As a solo developer, I have grown tired of the same cookie cutter projects being suggested online (TODO app etc),so I wanted to create something I had an interest in, and something to challenge me. 
but also a creative expression of my love for music and coding.<br>
The 3D Piano Site is a blend of advanced web technologies and musical interactivity, offering users a unique way to engage with music.

### How To Use With Computer Keyboard! (Controls)

For The White Keys use "A - #" then for the Black Keys use the keys above them (A = C3, W = C#3).<br>
To change octaves use "Z" and "X" <br>
To change Instruments use "-" and "="<br>

#### Features So Far!

- [x] **Different Piano Sounds**: Choose from a variety of piano sounds.
- [x] **Note Highlighting**: Highlight the notes you're playing and imported from MIDI
- [x] **Midi Keyboard Support**: Connect your MIDI keyboard for an interactive experience.
- [x] **Computer Keyboard Support**: Play the piano using your computer keyboard - no extra hardware needed.
- [x] **Raycasting for Mouse Interaction**: Play the piano by clicking on the keys with your mouse, thanks to raycasting.
- [x] **File Upload and Playback**: Upload MIDI files and play them back on the 3D piano (with the notes highlighted).
- [x] **Looping for Practice**: Focus on learning specific sections of a song with the looping feature.

#### Planned Features:
- [ ] **Customizable Piano+Highlighter+Background Colours**
- [ ] **The Keyboard Texture Letters**: ("A" key -> C3 note) shown up as a texture like it for the instrument name on the screen
- [ ] **Learning Mode**: You can't progress until you've hit all the correct notes 
- [ ] **More Instruments**: Instead of just a piano perhaps a custom synth....
- [ ] **Real Time Connection Online**: Play at the same time as your friends online!
- [ ] **Record+Export Midi Data**
- [ ] **Scale Mode**: Only play the notes inside of a certain scale
- [ ] **General Bug Fixes**: Please report them to me so I know what to fix!


## Conclusion
I've been working on this project on and off for 2 months (I haven't added commits the whole time whoopsy) whilst focussing on other projects.<br>
About a month ago I decided to just fully focus on this one so I could get something released I have finally reached my original project spec! 
or the time being I'm going to fully focus on the other project as I'll be learning a lot of new skills with it (.NET/C# backend development),
but I'm really proud of what I've accomplished so far, I will update this project I just won't be working on it as much. 
Unfortuently some days I am unable to code (due to having full time job and working 15 hour days) so I have to spend my time smartly.


*Proudly developed using 3js and Tone.js.*
